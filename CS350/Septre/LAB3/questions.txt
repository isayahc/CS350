Error 1:
result[n[i]]=q1[i]+q2[i]+q3[i]/3; 
This is an error because of order of operations 

Error2:
for (var i=1; i<n.length; i++) 
The iterator should start at the 0th position

Error3:
Quiz2 and Quiz3 was missing data. The only way for 
Nicholas' average grade to be 100 is for all quizes to 
equate to 100.
